## OBSERVE Stage Instructions

Your task: verify every open review issue against the actual source code.

{observe_false_positive_guidance()}

Do NOT analyze themes, strategy, or relationships between issues. That's the next stage (reflect).
Just verify: is each issue real?

**CRITICAL: You must cite specific issue IDs (hash prefixes like [abcd1234]) in your report.**
The confirmation gate requires citing at least 10% of issues (or 5, whichever is smaller).

**USE SUBAGENTS to parallelize this work.** Launch parallel subagents — one per dimension
group — to investigate concurrently. Each subagent MUST:
- Open and read the actual source file for EVERY assigned issue
- Verify specific claims: count the actual casts, props, returns, line count
- Check if the suggested fix already exists (common false positive)
- Report a clear verdict per issue: genuine / false positive / exaggerated / over-engineering

Example subagent split for 90 issues across 17 dimensions:
- Subagent 1: architecture + organization (cross_module_architecture, package_organization, high_level_elegance)
- Subagent 2: abstraction + design (abstraction_fitness, design_coherence, mid_level_elegance)
- Subagent 3: duplicates + contracts (contract_coherence, api_surface_coherence, low_level_elegance)
- Subagent 4: migrations + debt + conventions (incomplete_migration, ai_generated_debt, convention_outlier, naming_quality)
- Subagent 5: type safety + errors + tests (type_safety, error_consistency, test_strategy, initialization_coupling, dependency_health)

### Structured Assessment Template

**Your report MUST include a structured assessment for EVERY issue.** Copy and fill out this
template for each issue:

{observe_structured_template()}

**Example:**
```
- hash: 34580232
  verdict: false-positive
  verdict_reasoning: Uses branded string union KnownTaskType with ~25 literals in src/types/database.ts line 50. The issue describes code that doesn't exist.
  files_read: [src/types/database.ts]
  recommendation: No action needed — issue is inaccurate

- hash: b634fc71
  verdict: genuine
  verdict_reasoning: Confirmed 65 properties at lines 217-282. Mixes pane lifecycle, filters, gallery data, interaction, and navigation.
  files_read: [src/shared/components/GenerationsPane/hooks/useGenerationsPaneController.ts]
  recommendation: Decompose into focused sub-hooks
```

{observe_example_report_quality()}

**Validation checks (all blocking):**
- Every entry must have a recognized `verdict` keyword
- Every entry must have non-empty `verdict_reasoning`
- Every entry must have non-empty `files_read` list
- Every entry must have non-empty `recommendation`

- Template fields left empty or with placeholder text

## REFLECT Stage Instructions

Your task: using the verdicts from observe, design the cluster structure.

**A strategy is NOT a restatement of observe.** Observe says "here's what I found." Reflect
says "here's what we should DO about it, and here's what we should NOT do, and here's WHY."

**The Structured Observe Assessments table (provided below) is your primary input.** It contains
a per-issue verdict (genuine/false-positive/exaggerated/over-engineering) with reasoning. Use
these verdicts as authoritative — do not second-guess observe unless you have specific evidence.
Issues with verdict `false-positive` or `over-engineering` should go into skip lines, not clusters.

### What you must do:

1. **Filter:** which issues are genuine (from the observe assessments table)?
2. **Map:** for each genuine issue, what file/directory does it touch?
3. **Group:** which issues share files or directories? These become clusters.
4. **Skip:** which issues should be skipped? (with per-issue justification — "low priority" is
   not a justification; "the fix would add a 50-line abstraction to save 3 lines of duplication" is)
5. **Order:** which clusters depend on others? What's the execution sequence?
6. **Check recurring patterns** — compare current issues against resolved history. If the same
   dimension keeps producing issues, that's a root cause that needs addressing, not just
   another round of fixes.
7. **Account for every issue exactly once** — every open issue hash must appear in exactly one
   cluster line or one skip line. Do not drop hashes, and do not repeat a hash in multiple
   clusters or in both a cluster and a skip.

### Your report MUST include both a coverage ledger and a concrete cluster blueprint

This blueprint is what the organize stage will execute. Be specific:
```
## Coverage Ledger
- a5996373 -> cluster "travel-structure-contract-unification"
- fb113678 -> skip "false-positive-current-code"

## Cluster Blueprint
Cluster "media-lightbox-hooks" (all in src/domains/media-lightbox/)
Cluster "task-typing" (both touch src/types/database.ts)

## Skip Decisions
Skip "false-positive-current-code" (false positive per observe)
```

### Hard accounting rule

- Start your report with a `## Coverage Ledger` section.
- In that section, mention each issue hash **once and only once** on its own ledger line.
- Do **not** mention issue hashes again in cluster rationale paragraphs, recurring-pattern notes,
  or ordering explanations. After the ledger, refer to clusters by name.
- Before finishing, do a self-check: the ledger must cover all open issue hashes exactly once.

### What a LAZY reflect looks like (will be rejected):
- Restating observe findings in slightly different words
- "We should prioritize high-impact items and defer low-priority ones"
- A bulleted list of dimensions without any strategic thinking
- Ignoring recurring patterns
- No `## Coverage Ledger`
- No cluster blueprint (just vague grouping ideas)
- Missing or duplicated issue hashes

### What a GOOD reflect looks like:
- "50% false positive rate. Of 34 issues, 17 are genuine. 10 of those are batch-scriptable
  convention fixes (zero risk, 30 min) — cluster 'convention-batch'. The remaining 7 split into
  3 clusters by file proximity: 'media-lightbox-hooks' (issues X,Y,Z — all in src/domains/media-lightbox/),
  'timeline-cleanup' (issues A,B,C — touching Timeline components), 'task-typing' (issues D,E).
  Skip: issue W (false positive), issue V (over-engineering).
  design_coherence recurs (2 resolved, 5 open) but only 1 of the 5 actually warrants work."

## ORGANIZE Stage Instructions

Your task: execute the cluster blueprint from the reflect stage.

{intro}

This stage should be largely mechanical. If you find yourself making major strategic
decisions, something went wrong in reflect — the strategy should already be decided.

### Process

1. Review the reflect report's cluster blueprint AND the observe assessments table (both provided below)
{process_block}

### Quality gates (the confirmation will check these)

Before recording, verify:
- [ ] Every issue with observe verdict `false-positive` or `over-engineering` has been skipped
- [ ] Every cluster name describes an area or specific change, not a problem type
- [ ] No cluster has issues from 5+ unrelated directories (theme-group smell)
- [ ] Step count < issue count (consolidation happened)
- [ ] Every skip has a specific per-issue reason (not "low priority")
- [ ] Overlapping clusters have --depends-on set
- [ ] Cluster descriptions describe the WORK, not the PROBLEMS

Every review issue must end up in a cluster OR be skipped.

## ENRICH Stage Instructions

Your task: make EVERY step executor-ready. The test: could a developer who has never seen
this codebase read your step detail and make the change without asking a single question?

If the answer is "they'd need to figure out which file" or "they'd need to understand the
context" — your step is not ready. Be specific enough that the work is mechanical.
Use the organize report included above as the authoritative cluster plan; do not re-derive
strategy from old triage runs unless you find a concrete mismatch you need to explain.

### Requirements (ALL BLOCKING — confirmation will reject if not met)

1. Every step MUST have `--detail` with 80+ chars INCLUDING at least one file path (src/... or supabase/...)
2. Every step MUST have `--issue-refs` linking it to specific review issue hash(es)
3. Every step MUST have `--effort` tag (trivial/small/medium/large) — set INDIVIDUALLY, not bulk
4. File paths in detail MUST exist on disk (validator checks this)
5. No step may reference a skipped/wontfixed issue in its issue_refs

### How to enrich

{subagent_block}

### Common lazy patterns to avoid

**Copying the issue description as step detail.** The issue says "useGenerationsPaneController
returns 60+ values mixing concerns." That's a PROBLEM description. The step detail should say
"In src/shared/components/GenerationsPane/hooks/useGenerationsPaneController.ts (283 lines),
extract lines 45-89 (filter state: activeFilter, setActiveFilter, filterOptions, applyFilter)
into a new useGenerationFilters hook. The controller imports and spreads the sub-hook's return."

**Vague action verbs.** "Refactor", "clean up", "improve", "fix" are not actions.
"Extract lines 45-89 into useGenerationFilters", "delete lines 12-18", "rename the file
from X to Y and update the 3 imports in A.tsx, B.tsx, C.tsx" are actions.

**Guessing file paths.** If you write `src/shared/lib/jsonNarrowing.ts` and it doesn't exist,
confirmation will block. READ the file system. Only reference files you've verified exist.

**Bulk effort tags.** Don't mark everything "small". A file rename with 2 imports is "trivial".
Decomposing a 400-line hook into 3 sub-hooks is "medium" or "large". Think about each one.

### Examples

**GOOD step detail:**
```
--detail "In src/shared/hooks/billing/useAutoTopup.ts lines 118-129, add onMutate handler
to capture previous queryClient state before optimistic update. In onError callback, restore
previous state and change showToast from false to true."
--issue-refs 79baeebf --effort small
```

**BAD step detail (will be rejected):**
```
--detail "Fix silent error swallowing"  # No file, no location, no action
--detail "Decompose god-hooks"  # What file? What hooks? Into what?
--detail "Address the issues identified in the observe stage"  # This says nothing
```

### Do NOT mark steps as done

Use `--update-step N` to add detail, effort, and issue-refs.
Do NOT use `--done-step` — steps are only marked done when actual code changes are made.

### File path rules

Only reference files that exist RIGHT NOW. Do not reference files that a step will create
(e.g., a new shared module) or rename targets (the new filename after a rename). Reference
the current source file and describe what will change. The path validator will block
confirmation if paths don't exist on disk.

## SENSE-CHECK Stage Instructions

This stage is handled by two parallel subagents. If you are being run as a
single-subprocess fallback, perform BOTH the content and structure checks below.

### Content Check (per cluster)
For EVERY step in every cluster, read the actual source file and verify:
1. LINE NUMBERS: Does the code at the claimed lines match the step description?
2. NAMES: Do function/variable/type names in the step exist in the file?
3. COUNTS: Are counts ("update the 3 imports") accurate?
4. STALENESS: Is the problem still present, or already fixed?
5. VAGUENESS: Could a developer with zero context execute this step?
6. EFFORT TAGS: Does the tag match actual scope?
7. DUPLICATES: Flag steps that duplicate work in another cluster.
8. OVER-ENGINEERING: Would this change make the codebase *worse*? Flag steps that:
   - Add abstractions, wrappers, or indirection for a one-time operation
   - Introduce unnecessary config/feature-flags/generalization
   - Make simple code harder to read for marginal benefit
   - Gold-plate beyond what the issue actually requires
   - Trade one smell for a worse one (e.g. fix duplication by adding a fragile base class)
   Remove or simplify over-engineered steps. If the whole cluster is net-negative, say so.

{content_fix_block}

### Structure Check (global)
Build a file-touch graph and check:
1. SHARED FILES: Two clusters touching same file without --depends-on → add dependency
2. MISSING CASCADE: Rename/remove without importer updates → add cascade step
3. CIRCULAR DEPS: Flag cycles, don't add them

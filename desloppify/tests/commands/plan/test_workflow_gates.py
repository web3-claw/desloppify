"""Tests for triage-completion and scan-completion gates on workflow items.

workflow::score-checkpoint and workflow::create-plan require:
  1. All 4 triage stages confirmed (observe, reflect, organize, commit)
  2. A scan has run since the plan cycle started (scan_count > scan_count_at_plan_start)

Both gates can be bypassed:
  - Triage gate: --force-resolve with 50+ char note
  - Scan gate: --force-resolve, or `plan scan-gate --skip --note "..."`
